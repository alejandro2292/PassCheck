# PassCheck 

Small Python project to test password strength.

Currently, the program only checks basic rules:
  - minimum length
  - uppercase letters
  - lowercase letters
  - digits
  - special characters


## Future improvements

In the future, the program may include:
  - Checking passwords against common password lists (rockyou.txt, etc.).
  - Estimating the time needed to crack the password via brute force.
  - Using Python libraries like zxcvbn for more advanced analysis.
  - Giving automatic recommendations to improve weak passwords.
  - Maybe even adding a small web interface (Flask) or GUI (Tkinter) for a more interactive tool.
